# Hotel Management System
 This is a Python-based Hotel Management System that uses text to speech library to welcome the patrons. It can be also used to auto-generate the bills for the orders placed by customers

This project was created by me and my team as a mini - poject for our Introductory Python Course in our Fourth Semester. To see the project first hand follow these steps:

 # Installation Procedure:
 
 - Clone the repository into yours: 'git clone https://https://github.com/priyanka-p01/Hotel-Management-System'
 - Install the Tkinter Library for Graphic User Interface / GUI: 'pip install tk'
 - Install the text to speech converter Python Library: 'pip install pyttsx3'
 
 After doing this, you are good to go ahead and create an own version of a hotel management system. 'Happy Hacking!'
