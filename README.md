# Hotel Management System

This is a Python-based Hotel Management System that uses text to speech library to welcome the patrons. It can be also used to auto-generate the bills for the orders placed by customers

This project was created by me and my team as a mini - poject for our Introductory Python Course in our Fourth Semester. To see the project first hand follow these steps:


# Installation and Usage:

## Using pip
- Install using pip/pip3
    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/priyanka-p01/Hotel-Management-System.git
    ```

## By Cloning
- To clone repo use
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/priyanka-p01/Hotel-Management-System.git
    ```
- install hotelms
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Start Hotel Management System app

- Start Application using
    ```
    python -m hotelms
    ```


# Notes:
- Debian based users might need to install tkinter and espeak before starting the application. To install tkinter use:
    ```
    sudo apt install python3-tk espeak
    ```
- Linux users might need to use `python3` instead of `python` and `pip3` instead of `pip`.

After doing this, you are good to go ahead and create an own version of a hotel management system. `Happy Hacking!`
